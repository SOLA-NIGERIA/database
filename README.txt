Database repository for the Solutions for Open Land Administration
(SOLA) open source project. This repository contains sql scripts
and OS batch/command files for building and populating the SOLA 
PostgreSQL database.

SOLA uses multiple Git repositories for managing its code base.
The code repository is the super/parent repository. Refer to the 
README in that repository for details on all SOLA Git repositories. 

> Batch and Shell Command Files

Batch and shell command files supported by this repository include;

1)  create_database: Builds the SOLA database and loads it with 
    configuration and test data using SQL script files located 
    in the schema, config and data folders.



> Managing Database Changes

All changes to the database must be captured as a changeset script 
in the changeset folder. The steps required when implementing 
new database changes are;

1)  Create a new ticket in Lighthouse to describe the database 
    change that is being made. This will allocate a ticket number.
2)  Create and run your new changeset script against your local 
    development database to apply the change. 
	- The changeset script must be named using the Changeset 
      Naming Convention described below. 
	- Any new objects added to the database (e.g. tables, columns, 
      views, functions, etc) must include suitable database 
      comments to describe them. 
    - The changeset script must also update the system.version 
	  table with the new version number implied by the changeset 
      script file name.
3)  Depending on the changes that were applied, run the necessary 
    extract scripts. 
4)  Commit changes in git and push to Github.

For general development, it will not be necessary for other developers 
to re-run any of the changeset scripts â€“ they will just run the 
create_database script to pick up any changes in the primary source SQL 
files. The changeset scripts become important when it is necessary 
to upgrade an existing production databases. In this case the DBA will 
need to determine the changeset scripts to apply to upgrade their database 
with new features. 

> Changeset Naming Convention

Scripts should be named as <year><month><sequence char>_<Lighthouse ticket 
number>. The date fields will be based around the date the Lighthouse ticket
is initially fixed. E.g. If Lighthouse ticket 298 is fixed on the 12th Feb 
2014, the changeset script name is 1402a_298.sql. The next script created 
in Feb would be 1402b_<ticket number>, etc. 

The version number part of the script name is the date and sequence char 
(e.g. 1402a). The version number must be added to the system.version 
table when the changeset script executes.
